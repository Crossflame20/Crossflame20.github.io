## Hey guys. Just wanted to let you know I am learning JavaScript as we speak, so I will be able to develop some real projects soon.

## A 13-year-old developer learning how to use github.

Hi, my name is Crossflame20, or just Cross for short. Cross isn't my real name, but I want to stay anonymous. :)
I am in 8th grade, and love programming. This is my homepage, where I will post updates on my work and other stuff like that.
