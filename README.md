## Hey guys. Just wanted to let you know I will be posting a little calculator program on my profile sometime soon to test my knowledge of Javascript. I will put a link to it here on my homepage.

Hi, my name is Crossflame20, or just Cross for short. Cross isn't my real name, but I want to stay anonymous. :)
I am in 8th grade, and love programming. This is my homepage, where I will post updates on my work and other stuff like that.
